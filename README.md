# Conditional-Probability-
This project is about conditional probability that how the purchasing behavior can be distributed over age

we investigate how buying decisions are influenced by defining weighted probabilities for different age groups on a synthetic dataset of 50,000 people. Furthermore, we contrast our results against all ages having the same purchasing probabilities. The research offers valuable insight into how demographic variables should be taken more seriously when predictive models are run in business contexts.

The aim is to then compute it and also compare in the case of weighted vs unweighted scenarios for 50-year-old. It will show how purchase probability is affected by age-based weighting and allow for an examination of whether the results are robust or biased.
